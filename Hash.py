        Complete the implementation of the method hash(); be sure to
        uncomment the value returned!

        Use (ord)inStr[i] to convert the character at position i
        to the integer value of its ASCII code.

        NOTE that the indexing of the characters in a Python string is reversed
        from what we used in lecture.
